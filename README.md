# Hangman Game

This is a classic Hangman game built using React. It was developed as part of a study project to practice React development and CSS styling.

## Features

- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices
- Visual stickman drawing that progresses with wrong guesses
- A scoreboard that tracks wins and losses
- An intuitive interface with a restart button

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/kajus303/50-grupe-hangman-react.git
   cd 50-grupe-hangman-react

2. Install the dependencies:

   npm install

3. Run the development server:

   npm run dev

## How to Play
